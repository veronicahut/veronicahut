My name is Veronica and I am currently a student learning computer programming. I have taken programming classes such as HTML and CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python. For the past few years, I have used SQL, VBA for MS Access, and VB.Net at my job. I plan to continue learning and growing as a developer.
